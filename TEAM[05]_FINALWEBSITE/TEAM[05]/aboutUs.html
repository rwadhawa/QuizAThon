                        website for people to enjoy. I have been able to
                        deepen my understanding in the topics of html, javascript, and css, while having fun expressing
                        my inner creative side within this project. I hope
                        you have enjoyed our project, and I'll never forget this experience. Contact us if you have any

                         I learned new skills from teammates. The benefits of being a 1st year Stevens Institute 
                         of Technology student is being exposed to many new skills such as JS, CSS, and html 
                         programming. In addition, by helping with the creation of this website, I was also able 
                         to learn many new trivia facts that I can use with my friends and family. I would be happy 
                         to help anyone with any questions on the development of this website!

                    <p class="info">Currently in my Freshman year of college at Stevens, helping create this website opened 
                        by eyes to future project work.  It was an enjoyable experience, and I learned about CSS, 
                        HTML, and Javascript as I went.  It also allowed for me to get better at editing images 
                        for transparency purposes.  This project has many different types of questions, for many 
                        different types of people to enjoy.  I hope it suits your needs, or perhaps you will learn 
                        something new!  Contact any of us if an issue arises.</p>

                        This website was extremely fun to create as I was able to use html and css, for the first 
                        time, which is the framework for almost all of the websites I have ever visited. I hope 
                        you enjoyed all of the quizzes offered and scored very well. If you have any questions or 
                        recommendations, feel free to reach out anytime. </p>
